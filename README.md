# recipes-for-the-one-eyed-wizard
Welcome to the README,

This is my first project in HTML and the odin project
has strongly encourage it to be about recipes. So, within these .html
files, you will find a couple of my favorite recipes right now. I am going to journal within the walls of this README as I go through it.

Okay so I have offically made/changed everything and uploaded it all to github! I feel like I should have been making more commits along the journey, but I was able to do it all in only a day so maybe that would have been too much extra work.
